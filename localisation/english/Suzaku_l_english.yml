suzaku.1.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 1"
suzaku.1.d:0 "Some days had passed since the secret transfer of Kururugi and his son Suzaku into the new isolated home, but something wasn't right inside Suzaku. He witnessed the horrors of the war in first person, but he believed he could rely, at least, on his father. This changed after Suzaku read some papers, forgotten by Kururugi on the floor, that made him shout without thinking-\n\n"What's the meaning of this, dad!?"\n\n"What to you mean, Suzaku?"\n\n"Do you really plan to continue Operation Archer until the very end?!"\n\n"Well...it's the only hope to save Japan after all..."\n\n"Are you kidding me? The Britannians are killing thousands of Japanese people every day! Why don'y you just surrender to the enemy!"\n\n"And throw away our identity,our nation! We'll be lapdogs!\n\n"But think about the lives that would be spared, don't you care about them?!"\n\n"Precisely because I CARE about them, I want to support the extreme struggle to the last man!"\n\n"Enough excuses! Tell me honestly if you are determined to do this madness!""
suzaku.1.a:0 ""I can only promise you that Operation Archer could be post-poned.""
suzaku.1.b:0 ""This is necessary Suzaku! We can't lose our determination to fight now!""
suzaku.2.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 2"
suzaku.2.d:0 "After a brief silence, Kururugi noticed his son was calmer, but he seemed ready to confront him once and for all, so he continued with the argument.\n\n"Is this really necessary?"\n\n"Japan stands alone, we are the only ones who can do this."\n\n"Then ask for help to other nations! I know they will be scared of Britannia, but we could offer them some Sakuradite!"\n\n"Don't make me laugh! Sakuradite is the main reason we are in this situation after all."\n\n"That's true, but..."\n\n"Our so-called friendly nations won't move an inch for us, and besides we can't sold out our treasure for foreign exploitment!"\n\n"Doesn't it seem a more manageable price instead of human lives?"\n\n"Listen to me, now the price of a human life is less than a mine of Sakuradite."\n\n"What are you saying..."\n\n"You heard me! You are too young to understand after all!"\n\n"You are joking, right?!""
suzaku.2.a:0 ""I've never been so damn serious in my fucking life!""
suzaku.2.b:0 ""Sorry Suzaku, I spoke without thinking...""
suzaku.3.t:0 "A Small Quarrel-Part 3"
suzaku.3.d:0 "Now, Suzaku was shaking and he was looking at a knife, which was laying on a small drawer. The situation was really tense and Suzaku had to take some time in order to finish this once and for all.\n\n"Then, what about the future of Nunnally and Lelouch?"\n\n"Can we change topic for now?"\n\n"Hell no! Tell me what are they going to do while this war continues any longer!"\n\n"Don't worry, I have already prepared a plan for them."\n\n"You are lying, aren't you!"\n\n"Listen Suzaku, they are Britannians, they are the ENEMY. Have you forgotten that already?"\n\n"That doesn't mean nothing for me anymore!"\n\n"You sure have changed since the last time we have met them, aren't you?"\n\n"I told you to not change subject. Now, what is your plan?""
suzaku.3.a:0 ""They will be sent to China, a safer place than this endless warzone.""
suzaku.3.b:0 ""...I will offer their lifes to Britannia, to save our country.""
