area11.1.t:0 "Orders From Bismark"
area11.1.d:0 "As we are beginning the process of erasing the old Japanese identity and administration, the SRA has ordered the overwrite of the old Japanese legal and judicial code, in favour of a version similar to the Homeland one. Despite this, we have also the consider the ongoing insurgency and the very low support from locals and Britannians alike in the Area.\n\nIndeed, the administration must decide if the new code will be instantly enacted all over the country or it'll be introduced slowly and behind the curtains.\n\nIn the first case, we'll face some instability in the near future, but the second option will make us look weak in front of the resistance."
area11.1.a:0 "Introduce Them Step By Step"
area11.1.b:0 "Pull Them Quickly!"

area11.2.t:0 "Old Gods, New Masters"
area11.2.d:0 "Although Britannia has imposed his mighty rule over Japan, the daily reports are showing a certain opposition to embrace Britannian values and culture. For this reason we must confine and liquidate all signs of the decadent Japanese tradition, including the religious aspect. Since the recent administrative division of the country, the army has often found Shintoist monuments, temples and traditional buildings, especially in the countryside.\n\nFor Viceroy Bismark, the solution is simple and fair: the systematic destruction of every trace of this nonsense. In this way, we'll clear out various zone to re-use for Britannian structures and, most important of all, a major point of Japanese identity is going to vanish forever. Eventually, the operation will be carried out along the normal anti-insurgency expeditions, to maxime the efficiency of the project."
area11.2.a:0 "Tear Down Those Temples!"

area11.3.t:0 "Fightings in The SRA"
area11.3.d:0 "After the recent consolidation of our administrative hold over Area 11, it seems that various elements within the rival factions of the SRA are trying to gain more influence and power. In particular, the Purist Faction has been doing hidden sabotages to our reforms n the last months, considered to bee too "gentle" for the Elevens. Furthermore, many nobles have already expressed their desire to move to the new planned settlements, and they WILL have a considerable political weight.\n\nLuckily, Bismark has been strenghtening his grip over the SRA as well, and the Iron Viceroy is not going to tolerate any indirect or direct confrontation to his authority. In fact, he revealed his intention to use the Secret Services and loyal Generals to keep in track certain individuals and make sure... that his projects will go as planned."
area11.3.a:0 "Bismark Rule Is Absolute."

area11.4.t:0 "Old Gods, New Masters-2"
area11.4.d:0 "After the first phase of de-japaneseization, that interested mainly material structures and symbols, time has finally come to hit the very core of old society and tradition. In particular, all religious-Shintoist writings, along its vocal expression in public places and houses, will be severely banned and rituals of any ideology or faith will be punished with forced labours. Furthermore, any allegiance to the old flag or Kururugi will mean instant deportation to the New Anglia penal colony or the living hell of Area 7.\n\nAfter all, all aspects linked to traditional dresses, dates, cultural festivals and, especially, decadent habits or beheviour are going to disappear in a way or another. One little suppression after another, we also be able to partially reduce the future unrests and confuse the public and the resistance. Indeed, it's our duty to educate Elevens to our superior culture and embrace the mighty Imperial teachings, following the doctrine of Saint Charles Darwin and Social Darwinism."
area11.4.a:0 "Piece by Piece, The Whole Structure Will Crash Down..."

area11.5.t:0 "Opening Of Tokyo Settlement"
area11.5.d:0 "Many journalists from all over the world were called to see the construction site of the brand new Tokyo Settlement, which would have been reserved only for high-ranking nobles and the government. Bismark was proud to show the colossal building to the public, who was, for the most part, astonished by the palace's height. Only the European press seemed to be scared of the site, maybe thinking this might be the near future of Paris or Sankt Petersburg, considering the recent tensions in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAfter the initial introduction, the so-called Iron Viceroy explained that this was the symbol of the new Britannian personal ownership of the islands for the following decades to come. Furthermore, he invited the whole world to stop using or thinking about a possible "Japan", because in that moment they had its official funeral; obviously, this was instantly followed by numerous laughs from the public.\n\nSome time after the cerimony, when Bismark retired to SRA provisional centre, some Officers informed him of a probably avoided terrist bombing planned by the resistance in the site. He loudly cursed and he quickly thought, "We must activate that damn Operation Sunset as soon as possible!""
area11.5.a:0 "Britannian Architecture Is The Best!"

area11.6.t:0 "Economic Report No.72"
area11.6.d:0 "Before activating the financial relief plan, the Viceroy has issued an urgent report to verify the state of Japanese industry after the Pacific War, and the results are, to say at least, worrying.Virtually all light industry has been crippled following the general chaos caused by Kururugi's death. Furthermore, a good part of heavy industry, which was limited also before the invasion, has been completely destroyed by our Knightmares. The Sakuradite mines, the main reason of the conflict, are mostly intact, but nearly fifty percent is in the resistance hand or controlled by the powerful Kirihara remnants. Our specialists have admitted that the difficult geographical location of the mines has severly impacted our efficiency and, as a result of this, they can't be properly exploited.\n\nIn order to relieve the situation, many experts have advised a strong collaboration with Britannian conglomerates, which will deploy mercenary troops from China. This will surely be costly, but it's the option favoured by the aristocracy and the Purist faction.On the other hand, Bismark is more keen on a strategic alliance with the Kyoto House, which will provoke a quick economic relief and has a deep knowledge of the territory. Obviously, this will be hidden from the eyes of the Knights of Round and Britannian press, although the Emperor has allowed us a certain range of maneuver."
area11.6.a:0 "We can't trust those Elevens."
area11.6.b:0 "Bismark orders, we obey."
area11.7.t:0 "Meeting At Fuji"
area11.7.d:0 "It was about midnight, and Bismark was travelling with some guards near the old Fuji mine; the place of the meeting was proposed by the Kyoto House, as it was one of the least visited zones in Japan after the great chaos. Everything was according to the plan of the Viceroy, as the old Japanese corporations were ready to negotiate an informal truce and technically submit to the Britannian authority, guaranteeing the functioning of the immense Sakuradite's extraction sites all over Area 11.\n\nThe secret deal included also a general amnesty to all components of Kyoto House, who will actively collaborate to the reconstruction and will temporary cease all support to the Cliques resistance. In particular, Kirihara, the previous economic minister of Japan, was sent as a rapresentatives of all industrial groups, to talk with Bismark, who seemed more than happy to break the main base of the annoying sabotages.Obsviously, at least for the initial times, the deal will be shared only with the most trusted officials and the opposition won't be able to exploit this episode."
area11.7.a:0 "This Must Not Leave The Area, You Hear Me?"
area11.8.t:0 "A Chat With Odysseus"
area11.8.d:0 "Bismark was preparing to receive Prime Minister Odysseus in the new Tokyo Settlement; although the Prince was officially here for holiday purposes, he would use the occasion to listen to the Viceroy's economic demands, too. In particular, Bismark had already made the request to extremely-low interest loans from the major Britannian conglomerates, but since these were controlled by the hostile great Britannian families, only the permission of a royal prince could have unlocked the situation.\n\nOdysseus was tired as always, with some traits of general boredom, just as last time the two men met, several years ago, in Pendragon for family matters. Bismark was already preparing his rethoric skills to convince the Prince, but he was stunned while Odysseus loudly said\n\n"Ahh, I can give you whatever loan you want Knight Of One, as long as I don't have to travel to these ruins!"\n\nThe Viceroy thought it'd be easy, but not THAT easy."
area11.8.a:0 "Heh, too easy."
area11.9.t:0 "The Underground Economy"
area11.9.d:0 "A radical economic reconstruction couldn't be possible without the suppression of the underground economy, present in the Area since the first years after the Pacific War. Although it has saved numerous civilians from a total deprivation of fundamental goods, such as food, clothes or tools, it has been widely exploited in these months by the Cliques, in order to gather armaments and guns from both the Area or China.\n\nFurthermore, it is increasingly becoming a problem for the SRA and the corporations, since a giant dark market has emerged as an hub for illegal trade, empowering Yakuza and local corrupted officers. Bismark has therefore decided a violent suppression, using military forces and loyal spies to localise the major illegal networks or other operations; indeed, this will surely damage the enemies of Britannia."
area11.9.a:0 "They Will Suffer!"
area11.10.t:0 "The Social Ladder"
area11.10.d:0 "According to the principles of our ideology, Social-Darwinism, we will radically reorganise the society of Area 11 and its labour market. In particular, a rigid social hierarchy will be established and it will resemble the structure of the other Areas' one. The Nobles and the Aristocrats will be positioned in the upper class, although the top of the pyramid will always be occupied by the Emperor, with the royal family, and the Knights of Rounds; furthermore, low and middle ranking officers, the bureaucracy and the organized-crime will be placed in the middle class.\n\nEventually, the lower class will be rapresented by the ordinary Britannian citizens and below the Honorary Britannians (Elevens who decided to serve in the Britannian Army in exchange for minimal human rights), while the Elevens at the bottom."
area11.10.a:0 "Disequality Is Strength!"
area11.11.t:0 "Modifying The Landscape"
area11.11.d:0 "Viceroy Bismark has just announced to the mainland his intention, in front of the SRA, to implement Project Borehole within this month. Project Borehole was a recent plan designed by various economists and engineers at the direct orders of Bismark, several months after the Second Pacific War, and it provided information about the construction of the greatest mine the world has ever seen. Furthermore, it assured a very high profit with the maximun efficiency, although it required a great deal of energy and extensive manpower. Luckily, the Geass Order has found the massive reserve of Sakuradite behind Mount Fuji, the perfect location to build the structure.\n\nIn this case, the landscape will be severely damaged, but it's still acceptable for the sake of resources; indeed, we won't make the same errors of Kururugi and sabotage our minerary industry just for an empty nationalism."
area11.11.d:0 "Maximum Efficiency!"
area11.12.t:0 "Taking Down The Legacy"
area11.12.d:0 "Despite Kirihara's departure into an hidden location and the collapse of his industries, it seems that the other members of the Kyoto House are still trying to take time and decide their move, supported by Kaguya Sumeragi, who had close ties with old Prime Minister Kururugi. The SRA, against Bismark advice, has decided to issue a series of mandates to take down the remaining rapresentatives of the old Japanese legacy.\n\nIn precedence, the Laws of Dissolution hit only Kirihara, since they were aimed at taking direct control of Sakuradite rafineries, but we understimated the tenacity of the remaining members of the Kyoto group. Finally, we expect that, with this last provisions, their economic activity, directly linked to the support for the resistance, will be severely bogged down, along the legacy of Kururugi."
area11.12.a:0 "They were Enemies of Britannia."
area11.13.t:0 "New Office Of Human Resources"
area11.13.d:0 "New directives from the SRA has ordered the division of the Honorary Britannians into two groups: the first one will join as cannon fodder in the garrison army, while the rest will be put to work in special relief zones, including many slaves from South America. These camps will be established to favour a quick economic growth, with the reconstruction of many industrial parks and Sakuradite rafineries.\n\nThe administrative part, instead, will be controlled by the economic branch of the SRA, excluding Bismark group, in close ties with the corporations. Although this, the process is going to require considerable efforts and the public order, since many reports indicated riots in the major camps. Hopefully, this is the reason we have a military garrison, right?"
area11.13.a:0 "Work Makes You Free!"
area11.14.t:0 "Tokyo Declaration"
area11.14.d:0 "Near midnight, Bismark was seen heading towards the Fuji Mount, and immediately blocked by some guards loyal to the SRA, while Kirihara was seen in the same area by our spies. The connection was clear, and so the intentions of Bismark, who was forced to give in our demands. In the following days, he agreed to break any deal with the Kyoto House and make a hoint declaration, in Tokyo Settlment, condemning the old Japanese government and its industries, in particular Kirihara.\n\nWith this step, we have assured the continuation of the standard Britannian economic politics, and the predominance of the pure Britannian conglomerates, which will operate in the territory without any further restriction.This victory will surely favour the power of radical factions within the SRA, purists and nobles in head."

A11_brit_corp_desc:0 "Bismark is a fool to think he can bypass Britannian law, and the SRA's economic branch will take over the process, by formally inviting the families ,of the high-aristocracy, present in Pendragon, with their financial corporations.

A11_repulse_guard:0 "Repulse The Old Guard"
A11_repulse_guard_desc:0 "The Cliques are tenacious and they are counter-attacking our positions in the mountains, even defending isolated strongholds until the last man. But it's only a question of time, their forts are nothing compared to our Knightmares and Bismark's genius."
A11_death_penalties:0 "Death Penalties For You!"
A11_death_penalties_desc:0 "The firing squad has been a very efficient method of containment in the other Areas, so why don't utilize it here too? Under the personal orders of Bismark, seventy percent of all captured manpower will be sentenced to death once in our hands, but obviously we will trick them into surrendering."
A11_raze_campaigns:0 "Raze The Countryside"
A11_raze_campaigns_desc:0 "Natural barriers and forests are often used by the rebels to operate sabotages or ambushes to our army; for this reason, an exstensive operation of cleaning will be put in place, and its success will be guaranteed by Knightmares' protection. For some cases, even the villages won't be excluded..."
A11_oper_lazarus:0 "Operation Sunset"
A11_oper_lazarus_desc:0 "The final blow to the Cliques is near; all military forces will be coordinated by the personal command of Bismark to eradicate major outposts in the countryside and conquest the remaining Sakuradite rafineries in their control. Indeed, their days are numbered."
A11_retirement_bismark:0 "The Work Is Complete"
A11_retirement_bismark_desc:0 "The economic reforms are complete and we have achieved an economic balance in the Area; some may call it stagnation but it's still better than the total mess of several years ago. The process has been tiring though, and rumors says current Viceroy could be thinking of an early retirement..."
A11_open_civ_govern:0 "Introduce A Civilian Administration"
A11_open_civ_govern_desc:0 "Bismark will retire in few months and bureaucratic practises are being compilated to formally disband the SRA and introduce a standard government, like all other Areas."
A11_nominate_clovis:0 "Nominate Clovis La Britannia"
A11_nominate_clovis_desc:0 "Emperor Charles has decided that Bismark's vacant position will be occupied by his son Clovis La Britannia. The Prince has never assumed the responsabilities of a Viceroy, and many fears his inexperience will be lethal to the careful balance achieved by Bismark."

A11_Suppression_Campaign_desc:0 "Although we have already claimed a complete military victory against Japan, the majority of their Generals and Ministers have flew the country and, from their new bases abroad, they are now directing subversive actions against the occupation; considering that many officers and soldiers have §Rrefused to surrender§!. The majority of the fightings are localised in the §Ycountryside§!, outside Tokyo metropolitan area, and in the main islands, in particular §YHokkaido§! and §YKyushu§!. With the Homeland support, secret services and -carrot and stick- strategies, we have to keep under control and, possibly, eradicate all the formal resistance!"
