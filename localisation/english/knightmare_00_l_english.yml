 sakuradite_extraction: "Sakuradite Extraction"
 sakuradite_extraction_desc: "Sakuradite is both extremely unstable and extremely explosive; a single tanker filled with it had enough destructive force to completely destroy an entire fleet of ships belonging to the Japanese Liberation Front when it was detonated. Sakuradite has both superconductive and radioactive properties, and thus, it is both very valuable and necessary in the production of Knightmare Frames. As a high temperature super conductor, it is used in seventh generation Knightmares and above to conserve energy for high energy demand systems such as Blaze Luminous and Float Systems. As a radioactive material, it is used to power Knightmare Frames and fuel nuclear bombs."
